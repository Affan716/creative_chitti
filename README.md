AI Calculator Challenge
This is a dynamic, web-based calculator that integrates a unique AI-powered math challenge. The project is designed to be both a functional calculator and an engaging puzzle game, testing a user's problem-solving skills and efficiency in number manipulation.

Features
Standard Calculator: A fully operational calculator for basic addition. It's built to be intuitive and easy to use.

AI Math Challenge: The core feature that transforms the calculator into a game. The AI generates a target "goal" number and a set of "numbers to use". The challenges are procedurally generated, ensuring a new experience with every game.

Interactive Gameplay: Users must use the provided numbers to reach the goal, with the ability to add and reset the total. The calculator's buttons are disabled during the challenge to ensure the user only uses the designated numbers.

Real-time Feedback: The AI validates the user's answer and provides instant feedback on whether the challenge was solved correctly.

Hints System: A multi-level hint system to assist users who get stuck on a challenge. Hints are designed to guide the user's thinking without giving away the direct answer.

How to Play
Click the "New Challenge" button to start a new game. The AI will display a "Goal" number and a list of "Numbers to use".

Use the calculator buttons to add the "Numbers to use" and try to reach the "Goal" number.

Click the "Check Answer" button to see if your total matches the goal.

If you get stuck, you can click the "ðŸ’¡ Hint" button for a clue.

If you want to start over, simply click "New Challenge" again.

Technology Used
HTML: Provides the structural foundation for the calculator and the AI challenge section.

CSS: Styles the user interface, making it visually appealing and responsive across different screen sizes.

JavaScript: Powers all the interactive logic, including the calculator's functions and the AI's challenge generation, validation, and hint systems.
